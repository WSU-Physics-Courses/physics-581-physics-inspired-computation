# ----- Usage -----

define HELP_MESSAGE

This Makefile provides several tools to help initialize the project.  It is primarly designed
to help get a CoCalc project up an runnning, but should work on other platforms.

Variables:
   ANACONDA2020: (= "$(ANACONDA2020)")
                     If defined, then we assume we are on CoCalc and use this to activate
                     the conda base envrionment. Otherwise, you must make sure that the ACTIVATE
                     command works properly.
   ACTIVATE: (= "$(ACTIVATE)")
                     Command to activate a conda environment as `$$(ACTIVATE) <env name>`
                     Defaults to `conda activate`.
   ANACONDA_PROJECT: (= "$(ANACONDA_PROJECT)")
                     Command to run the `anaconda-project` command.  If you need to first
                     activate an environment (as on CoCalc), then this should do that.
                     Defaults to `anaconda-project`.
   ENV: (= "$(ENV)")
                     Name of the conda environment user by the project.
                     (Customizations have not been tested.)
                     Defaults to `phys-581-2021`.
   ENV_PATH: (= "$(ENV_PATH)")
                     Path to the conda environment user by the project.
                     (Customizations have not been tested.)
                     Defaults to `envs/$$(ENV)`.
   ACTIVATE_PROJECT: (= "$(ACTIVATE_PROJECT)")
                     Command to activate the project environment in the shell.
                     Defaults to `$$(ACTIVATE)  $$(ENV)`.

Initialization:
   make init         Initialize the environment and kernel.
   make cocalc-init  Do some CoCalc-specific things like install mmf-setup, and activate the
                     environment in ~/.bash_aliases.  This is called by `make init`
                     if ANACONDA2020 is defined, so usually does not need to be called explicitly.

Maintenance:
   make clean        Call conda clean --all: saves disk space.
   make reallyclean  delete the environments and kernel as well.
