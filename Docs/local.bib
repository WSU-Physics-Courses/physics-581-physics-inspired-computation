	abstract = { A framework for discrete variable representation
(DVR) basis sets is developed that is suitable for
multidimensional generalizations. Those
generalizations will be presented in future
publications. The new axiomatization of the DVR
construction places projection operators in a
central role and integrates semiclassical and phase
space concepts into the basic framework. Rates of
convergence of basis set expansions are emphasized,
and it is shown that the DVR method gives
exponential convergence, assuming conditions of
analyticity and boundary conditions are met. A
discussion of nonorthogonal generalizations of DVR
functions is presented, in which it is shown that
projected -functions and interpolating functions
form a biorthogonal basis. It is also shown that one
of the generalized DVR proposals due to Szalay
[J. Chem. Phys. 105, 6940 (1996)] gives exponential
convergence.}}
