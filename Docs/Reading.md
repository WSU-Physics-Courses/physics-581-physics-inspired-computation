Readings
========

## Textbook

The course will make regular reference to {cite:p}`Gezerlis:2020`.

## Bayesian Analysis

For a serious introduction to Bayesian Analysis, read sections I through III.A of
{cite:p}`Toussaint:2011`.

## Gaussian Processes

* {cite:p}`Gelman:2013`: A good comprehensive reference.  Available for non-commercial
  from the [author's webpage](https://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/).
* {cite:p}`Melendez:2019`: An application to nuclear theory with associated code [`gsum`].
* {cite:p}`Rasmussen:2006`: Another nice book that formed the basis for the
  implementations in [scikit-learn].

## Matrix Cookbook

The Matrix Cookbook {cite:p}`Petersen:2012` contains many useful formulae for working with matrices (without
proof).  This version is rather old, so the following updates may also be useful:

* [Matrix Forensics](https://github.com/r-barnes/MatrixForensics): An open-source
  repository with a compendium of formulae.
* [The Matrix Reference Manual](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/matrix/intro.html).
